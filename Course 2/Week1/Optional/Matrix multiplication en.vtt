00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:04.380
You know that a matrix is

2
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.455
just a block or 2D
array of numbers.

3
00:00:07.455 --> 00:00:09.615
What does it mean to multiply

4
00:00:09.615 --> 00:00:12.090
two matrices? Let's take a look.

5
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.990
In order to build up to
multiplying matrices,

6
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.330
let's start by looking at

7
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.615
how we take dot products
between vectors.

8
00:00:21.615 --> 00:00:23.940
Let's use the example of taking

9
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.370
the dot product
between this vector 1,

10
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.625
2 and this vector 3, 4.

11
00:00:29.625 --> 00:00:33.210
If z is the dot product
between these two vectors,

12
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.190
then you compute z by

13
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.540
multiplying the first element
by the first element here,

14
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.785
it's 1 times 3, plus

15
00:00:40.785 --> 00:00:42.690
the second element times

16
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.505
the second element
plus 2 times 4,

17
00:00:44.505 --> 00:00:47.385
and so that's just 3 plus 8,

18
00:00:47.385 --> 00:00:49.740
which is equal to 11.

19
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.260
In the more general case,

20
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.380
if z is the dot product between
a vector a and vector w,

21
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.345
then you compute z by

22
00:01:00.345 --> 00:01:02.430
multiplying the first
element together and

23
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.740
then the second elements
together and the third and so

24
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.935
on and then adding up
all of these products.

25
00:01:06.935 --> 00:01:10.095
That's the vector,
vector dot product.

26
00:01:10.095 --> 00:01:11.760
It turns out there's

27
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.510
another equivalent way of
writing a dot product,

28
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.005
which has given a vector a,

29
00:01:18.005 --> 00:01:21.555
that is, 1, 2
written as a column.

30
00:01:21.555 --> 00:01:24.735
You can turn this into a row.

31
00:01:24.735 --> 00:01:26.490
That is, you can
turn it from what's

32
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.770
called a column vector to

33
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.360
a row vector by taking
the transpose of a.

34
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.065
The transpose of the
vector a means you take

35
00:01:37.065 --> 00:01:42.705
this vector and lay its
elements on the side like this.

36
00:01:42.705 --> 00:01:48.360
It turns out that if you
multiply a transpose,

37
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.860
this is a row vector,

38
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.195
or you can think of this as
a one-by-two matrix with w,

39
00:01:54.195 --> 00:01:59.385
which you can now think of
as a two-by-one matrix.

40
00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:05.745
Then z equals a transpose times
w and this is the same as

41
00:02:05.745 --> 00:02:12.195
taking the dot product
between a and w. To recap,

42
00:02:12.195 --> 00:02:15.825
z equals the dot
product between a and w

43
00:02:15.825 --> 00:02:19.785
is the same as z
equals a transpose,

44
00:02:19.785 --> 00:02:21.960
that is a laid on the side,

45
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.710
multiplied by w and

46
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.775
this will be useful for

47
00:02:26.775 --> 00:02:29.250
understanding matrix
multiplication.

48
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.500
That these are just
two ways of writing

49
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.385
the exact same computation
to arrive at z.

50
00:02:35.385 --> 00:02:39.660
Now let's look at vector
matrix multiplication,

51
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.700
which is when you
take a vector and you

52
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.580
multiply a vector by a matrix.

53
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.310
Here again is the vector a 1,

54
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.290
2 and a transpose is
a laid on the side,

55
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.840
so rather than this
think of this as

56
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.820
a two-by-one matrix it
becomes a one-by-two matrix.

57
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.130
Let me now create

58
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.400
a two-by-two matrix w
with these four elements,

59
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.350
3, 4, 5, 6.

60
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.910
If you want to compute Z as

61
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:19.290
a transpose times w. Let's see
how you go about doing so.

62
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:28.215
It turns out that Z is going
to be a one-by-two matrix,

63
00:03:28.215 --> 00:03:30.810
and to compute the
first value of Z we're

64
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.390
going to take a transpose, 1,

65
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.475
2 here, and multiply that
by the first column of w,

66
00:03:38.475 --> 00:03:41.020
that's 3, 4.

67
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.505
To compute the
first element of Z,

68
00:03:44.505 --> 00:03:49.140
you end up with 1 times
3 plus 2 times 4,

69
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.020
which we saw earlier
is equal to 11,

70
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.935
and so the first
element of Z is 11.

71
00:03:55.935 --> 00:03:59.325
Let's figure out what's
the second element of Z.

72
00:03:59.325 --> 00:04:02.055
It turns out you just
repeat this process,

73
00:04:02.055 --> 00:04:04.800
but now multiplying
a transpose by

74
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.930
the second column of w.
To do that computation,

75
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:15.165
you have 1 times
5 plus 2 times 6,

76
00:04:15.165 --> 00:04:19.665
which is equal to 5
plus 12, which is 17.

77
00:04:19.665 --> 00:04:22.935
That's equal to 17.

78
00:04:22.935 --> 00:04:29.130
Z is equal to this one-by-two
matrix, 11 and 17.

79
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.280
Now, just one last thing,

80
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.770
and then that'll take us
to the end of this video,

81
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.270
which is how to take

82
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.700
vector matrix multiplication
and generalize

83
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.675
it to matrix matrix
multiplication.

84
00:04:42.675 --> 00:04:46.110
I have a matrix A with
these four elements,

85
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.470
the first column is 1,

86
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.950
2 and the second
column is negative 1,

87
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.540
negative 2 and I want
to know how to compute

88
00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:00.060
a transpose times w.
Unlike the previous slide,

89
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.720
A now is a matrix rather
than just the vector or

90
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.730
the matrix is just a set of

91
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.240
different vectors stacked
together in columns.

92
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.975
First let's figure out
what is A transpose.

93
00:05:12.975 --> 00:05:15.135
In order to compute A transpose,

94
00:05:15.135 --> 00:05:17.930
we're going to take
the columns of A and

95
00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.245
similar to what happened
when you transpose a vector,

96
00:05:21.245 --> 00:05:22.670
we're going to take the columns

97
00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:23.990
and lay them on the side,

98
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.750
one column at a time.

99
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.210
The first column 1,

100
00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.910
2 becomes the first row 1,

101
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.920
2, let's just laid on side,

102
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.410
and this second
column, negative 1,

103
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.010
negative 2 becomes laid
on the side negative 1,

104
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.750
negative 2 like this.

105
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.760
The way you transpose
a matrix is you take

106
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.805
the columns and you just lay
the columns on the side,

107
00:05:44.805 --> 00:05:46.140
one column at a time,

108
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.650
you end up with this
being A transpose.

109
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.175
Next we have this matrix W,

110
00:05:53.175 --> 00:05:56.190
which going to
write as 3,4, 5,6.

111
00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:00.450
There's a column 3, 4
and the column 5, 6.

112
00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.885
One way I encourage you
to think of matrices.

113
00:06:03.885 --> 00:06:05.940
At least there's useful for

114
00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.975
neural network implementations
is if you see a matrix,

115
00:06:09.975 --> 00:06:11.730
think of the columns of

116
00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:15.270
the matrix and if you see
the transpose of a matrix,

117
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.340
think of the rows of that
matrix as being grouped

118
00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.440
together as illustrated here,

119
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.225
with A and A transpose
as well as W. Now,

120
00:06:24.225 --> 00:06:28.905
let me show you how to
multiply A transpose and

121
00:06:28.905 --> 00:06:31.980
W. In order to carry out

122
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:36.390
this computation let me
call the columns of A,

123
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:42.090
a_1 and a_2 and that
means that a_1 transpose,

124
00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:44.325
this the first row
of A transpose,

125
00:06:44.325 --> 00:06:49.890
and a_2 transpose is the
second row of A transpose.

126
00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.810
Then same as before,

127
00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:57.435
let me call the columns
of W to be w_1 and w_2.

128
00:06:57.435 --> 00:07:02.025
It turns out that to
compute A transpose W,

129
00:07:02.025 --> 00:07:04.980
the first thing we
need to do is let's

130
00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.355
just ignore the second row of

131
00:07:08.355 --> 00:07:10.680
A and let's just
pay attention to

132
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.280
the first row of A and
let's take this row 1,

133
00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.970
2 that is a_1 transpose
and multiply that with

134
00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:20.280
W. You already know

135
00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.055
how to do that from
the previous slide.

136
00:07:23.055 --> 00:07:25.050
The first element is 1,

137
00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:28.440
2, inner product or dot
product we've 3, 4.

138
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.985
That ends up with 3 times 1
plus 2 times 4, which is 11.

139
00:07:32.985 --> 00:07:36.870
Then the second element is 1,

140
00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:38.550
2 A transpose,

141
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:40.065
inner product we've 5, 6.

142
00:07:40.065 --> 00:07:43.755
There's 5 times 1
plus 6 times 2,

143
00:07:43.755 --> 00:07:46.785
which is 5 plus 12, which is 17.

144
00:07:46.785 --> 00:07:49.965
That gives you the
first row of Z

145
00:07:49.965 --> 00:07:53.370
equals A transpose
W. All we've done is

146
00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:56.700
take a_1 transpose and multiply

147
00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:57.945
that by W. That's

148
00:07:57.945 --> 00:08:00.525
exactly what we did on
the previous slide.

149
00:08:00.525 --> 00:08:04.245
Next, let's forget a_1 for now,

150
00:08:04.245 --> 00:08:07.350
and let's just look
at a_2 and take

151
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:12.030
a_2 transpose and multiply
that by W. Now we

152
00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:16.530
have a_2 transpose times W. To

153
00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:18.660
compute that first we
take negative 1 and

154
00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:21.690
negative 2 and dot
product that with 3, 4.

155
00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:25.200
That's negative 1
times 3 plus negative

156
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:30.060
2 times 4 and that turns
out to be negative 11.

157
00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.880
Then we have to compute

158
00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.030
a_2 transpose times
the second column,

159
00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:39.555
and has negative 1 times 5
plus negative 2 times 6,

160
00:08:39.555 --> 00:08:43.380
and that turns out
to be negative 17.

161
00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:46.910
You end up with A
transpose times W is equal

162
00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:50.920
to this two-by-two
matrix over here.

163
00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:54.185
Let's talk about
the general form

164
00:08:54.185 --> 00:08:57.185
of matrix matrix multiplication.

165
00:08:57.185 --> 00:08:59.750
This was an example of how you

166
00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:02.060
multiply a vector with a matrix,

167
00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:03.440
or a matrix with

168
00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.320
a matrix is a lot of
dot products between

169
00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.940
vectors but ordered in

170
00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:11.090
a certain way to construct
the elements of the upper Z,

171
00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:13.120
one element at a time.

172
00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.975
I know this was a lot,

173
00:09:14.975 --> 00:09:16.460
